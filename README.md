Some helper scripts to get you started looking at the data for the 37Billion Mile challenge:
http://www.37billionmilechallenge.org/

Note, to get the data, go to the URL above, accept the license terms and download the data and put it in the subdirectory "data". If you get the companion data set, put it in "data/companion".

The data is not part of this git repository. But the use agreement has been uploaded.

To avoid mucking with the source data files, all processed data is in the "proc" directory.

To get started, I added two files which I was playing with to get familiar with the data, used to create this post:

delorean_extract.py // pull only the delorean records from the rae db
delorean_process.py // work with the new file proc/deloreans.csv
