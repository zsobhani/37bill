    <h2>Driving and Land Use: An Explanatory Model</h2>


<p>From the map below it’s clear that people drive less in urban areas. What explains this difference? Explore the map to test your assumptions, then continue below for an explanatory model.

<h3>Map Details</h3>
<p>
Select Miles of Driving per Day per Person and potential explanatory variables using the dropdown on the right. Select the scale using the other dropdown. Statewide data is shown at the zipcode level. Regional data is shown in 15 acre grid squares. <a href="">Complete description of variables and sources.</a>

We tested a variety of potential explanatory variables – demographics, income, density, land uses, street width, intersections, sidewalks, and transit availability. Comparing these one at a time against miles driven can be misleading. For example, considered by themselves, more sidewalks, buildings, and area property value are each associated with less driving. But once we control for other factors, it turns out that the apparent relationship of each of them to driving disappears. We find that fewer roads, more intersections, and frequent transit do have an independent effect on reducing driving. But by far the strongest predictors of driving are population density and owner-occupied housing.

<h2>A Model Incorporating Multiple Explanatory Factors</h2>
<p>

From the series of small multiples below we found a few surprises. What explains them? Explore the visualizations, then continue below for some explanations.
We tested a variety of potential explanatory variables – demographics, income, density, land uses, street width, intersections, sidewalks, and transit availability. The plots below show the relationship between driving and several explanatory variables, both before (dark red) and after (orange) controlling for other factors that affect driving. How are they different?

<h3>Explanatory Factors</h3>
<p>Comparing these one at a time against miles driven can be misleading. For example, considered by themselves, more sidewalks, buildings, and area property value are each associated with less driving. But once we control for other factors, it turns out that the apparent relationship of each of them to driving disappears. We find that fewer roads, more intersections, and frequent transit do have an independent effect on reducing driving. But by far the strongest predictors of driving are population density and owner-occupied housing.
</p>
<p>
Many factors are related to the observed variability in automobile miles traveled. Comparing each of these factors one at a time to miles per day per person can be misleading, because many of them vary together. For example, frequent transit service is generally only available in higher density areas, but high density also is expected to affect driving via congestion, parking, proximity, and biking and walking favorability. Thus any observed relationship between transit availability and driving may actually be the result of one of these other related variables. We have addressed this problem by estimating a multivariate model that uses all of these variables simultaneously. Multivariate regression models estimate the independent effect of each variable, controlling for all the others in the model.
</p>
<p>
The demographic factors included were the number of children, the number of seniors, the number of households (household size), and household income. These and other variables are shown in the table below. In addition to area household income (HHIncBG), we have two other variables that are related to income: percent of housing units that are owner-occupied (OwnPct) and total assessed value of all property in the grid cell (pttlasval).
</p>
<p>
We tested explanatory variables related to different aspects of the built environment that affect driving: 
</p>
<p>
<b>Proximity.</b> People living next to more potential opportunities (jobs, shopping, parks, etc) can reach these places without driving as far as others who are more isolate, or can reach them by other means (by walking, biking, or using public transit). However, just because people can go to a nearby job or grocery store, however, does not mean they will necessarily choose that option over a preferable one further away.  <b>Variables tested</b>: measures of population (pop10), employment (total_emp), buildings (pbld_sqm), and building size (far_agg) as well as an index related to the number of nearby schools (schwlkindx). Since the grid cells are all the same size, these figures can be taken as rough measures of the density of population, employment, and buildings.
</p>

<p><b>Cost of Driving. </b>The major variable costs of driving that vary over space are tolls, parking fees, and driver time. The first two only affect a small portion of trips, since roads and parking are generally free. However, traffic congestion and parking scarcity increases the time cost of driving greatly, especially in the older portions of the state that were built with narrower roads and limited off-street parking. Congestion may also be related to the size of the urban area, since in larger areas the flows of traffic may be greater. <b>Variables Tested</b>: the extent of the road network (prow_sqm), the amount of parking lots and driveways (ppaved_sqm), and the on-road distance to the nearest highway interchange. However, the proximity measures may also be related to the amount of roadway congestions– and thus are also potentially indicators of the cost of driving.
</p><p>
<b>Transit Accessibility.</b> Transit requires both a concentration of residences (for economical walk access) and a concentration of employment (or other attractions at the destination end of the trip, since driving egress is generally not feasible). Transit does best in locations that had already developed these patterns prior to the widespread suburbanization of people and jobs after the Second World War.<b> Variable Tested</b>: aggregate frequency of transit service within 0.25 miles of the Census block group (in which the grid cell is located) boundary per hour during evening peak period (SLD_d4c).
</p><p>
<b>Walk and Bike Access.</b> Walking and biking are favored not only by proximity, but also by grid networks that minimize travel distance and provide the possibility of walking or biking along low-volume, low-speed streets. A built-out street front also makes walking safer and more pleasant (compared to walking along buildings fronted by parking lots, for example.) The presence of sidewalks and bike paths may also increase walking and biking. <b>Variables Tested</b>: the number of intersections (intsctnden), which may differentiate older grid-based street networks from rural areas and suburban areas with cul-de-sac networks. We also have a measure of the number of sidewalks within the grid (sidewlksqm).

<h3>Model Results</h3>
<p>
This series of plots shows that the estimated relationships found in the regression modeling in many cases differ substantially from a simple comparison between the explanatory variable and driving. In each plot, the blue line shows miles driven from the data. The orange line shows the amount of driving  predicted <i>if all other variables were held constant</i>. The explanation of the discrepancies between the two lines is that many of these variables are interrelated. However the dataset is large enough (almost 100,000 observations) that it is possible to tease out the independent effects of each variable (except percent children and employment, which were not statistically significant). <a href="">Complete model results are available</a>.
</p><p>
One way of comparing the importance of the variables in the model is to look at <i>elasticity</i>, which is defined as the percent change in Miles per Day per Person that results from a 1% change in the independent variable. An elasticity that is larger than another one (in absolute value) means that the driving  is more sensitive to changes in that variable. The elasticities for this model are shown below. Three of them stand out as significantly higher than the rest: owner-occupied housing share, population, and households. Increasing population density is strongly related to reducing driving.  Increasing the share of homeowners would tend to increase driving: there is both an income effect (since homeowners tend to have higher than average income) and a spatial effect (since owned housing is most likely to be single-family housing).  All of the remaining variables but two have a measurable, but small, impact on driving. The most notable one is intersection density. This association could be because areas with a grid of streets are more conducive to walking, biking, and transit, and it could also be because such areas have narrow streets and limited off-street parking, making driving slower and more expensive.
