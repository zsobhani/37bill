    <h2> Massachusetts Grid Driving Data Analysis and Exploration</h2>



    <p>The map below shows data provided by MAPC in 250m grid squares (~15 acres) for selected towns in the Boston metro area. You can select other values to be displayed on the map from the map title.</p>

<p> Note the data on this map is q2 2010 data, to align most closely with the 2010 census data ignoring any grids for which there were both zero households and zero vehicles (more details from Paul here or somewhere).</p>
<p> Our goal is to explain miles traveled per person, we explored some of the following as explaintory variables: percent population of kids, seniors, population density, side walk length, school access, number of intersections. </p>

<p> Note that when zoomed out the map displays zip code level information. However, since the underlying data was from 250m square grid cells, we show metrics such as population as a density, so it is average population per 250mx250m grid (~15 acres).</p>

<p> Note correlation between population density, income and miles driven per person, this is pretty clear when looking at the wealthiest towns in MA (Dover and Weston, based on analysis of car values) and also the areas around Franklin Park in Boston (is this a lower income place, why is driving so low there? Is it just too terrible to drive around there?)</p>

    This series of plots shows results of our regression modeling. The blue line shows how the miles travelled varies with the actual data. The orange line shows change the model predicts, when all other variables are held constant.
